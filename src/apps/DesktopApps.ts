    I am a web developer from Moscow, Russia.
    ------------------------
    Professional background:

    With 5 years of experience in programming, I have honed my skills in algorithms and data structures, backend and frontend
    technologies, databases, software architecture and cryptography.
    Currently, my primary tech stack comprises a robust set of technologies including TypeScript, React, MobX, Golang and PostgreSQL.
    These tools are the backbone of my development work, enabling me to deliver high-quality, scalable solutions efficiently.
    In addition to my core stack, I bring hands-on experience with a diverse range of technologies such as Vue3, Python, NodeJS, C#, ASP.NET, C++, and MongoDB.
    Recently, Iâ€™ve been expanding my expertise into the DevOps domain, actively working with Docker, Kubernetes, and other CI/CD tools.
    ------------------------
    Notable Achievements:

    During my studies, I developed more than 10 pet projects, which include an agile system task manager, a chess web platform,
    an web IDE with build-in leetcode clone, a cryptocurrency with its own blockchain and many others. I also participated and won many hackathons,
    which gave me enormous experience and knowledge.
